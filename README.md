# b_day_script
birthday php script

A simple form with two scripts on the src:
 
 The first one (datetime.php) inserts the specific date on the mysql database and the second one (selectdate.php)selects the date that 
 matches with the current day.
 
 I have put a simple echo statement that just print how many dates are equal with today's date but you can add whatever you want( a function
 that sends email with notifications etc)
